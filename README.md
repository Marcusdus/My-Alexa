# My-Alexa

Build your own Alexa

When you build an Alexa Smart Home skill, users can voice-control their cloud-connected devices by using your skill. ... Your skill reacts to the message by changing the state a device, such as by dimming a light, or by sending information about device state, such as by telling the user whether a light is on or off.
