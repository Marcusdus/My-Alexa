## Build your own Alexa.


When you build an Alexa Smart Home skill, users can voice-control their cloud-connected devices by using your skill. ... Your skill reacts to the message by changing the state a device, such as by dimming a light, or by sending information about device state, such as by telling the user whether a light is on or off.

### Libraries that you are going to use.
list is below.


For the robot to listen to our voice/speech
`pip install speechRecognition`

To speak out, or text to speech
`pip install pyttsx3`

For advance control on browser
`pip install pywhatkit`

To get wikipedia data
`pip install wikipedia`

To get funny jokes
`pip install pyjokes`

### For linux users
Learn all the above commands on terminal. Make sure to use `pip3`, because in linux `pip` refers for `python2` and `pip3` refers to `python3`.
Install these too - 
`pip3 install pyAudio`

In case any error pops up install this -
`pip3 install portAudio`
